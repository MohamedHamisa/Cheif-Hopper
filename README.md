# Cheif-Hopper

 Chief's bot is playing an old DOS-based game. There is a row of buildings of different heights arranged at each index along a number line. The bot starts at building 0 and at a height of 0. You must determine the minimum energy his bot needs at the start so that he can jump to the top of each building without his energy going below zero.
